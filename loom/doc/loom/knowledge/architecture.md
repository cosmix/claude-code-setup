## Module Moves (Mega-Cleanup Refactoring)

### Relocated Modules

- `compute_all_levels` moved from `commands/status/` to `plan/graph/levels.rs` (correct architectural layer)
- `MergeLock` moved from `orchestrator/progressive_merge/` to `git/merge/lock.rs` (correct layer)
- `truncate`/`truncate_for_display` moved from `commands/common/` to `utils.rs` (shared utility, used by 5+ layers)

### Removed Modules

- `verify/gates.rs` — zero callers, dead quality gate code
- `orchestrator/continuation/yaml_parse.rs` — removed
- Escalation system removed from `monitor/failure_tracking.rs` (RecoveryInitiated, StageEscalated, ContextRefreshNeeded, RecoveryType, should_escalate, mark_escalated)
- Dead methods removed: `short_label` from `models/failure.rs`, `get_state`/`heartbeat_watcher` from monitor

### Split Modules

- `commands/knowledge.rs` → `commands/knowledge/{mod,check,gc}.rs`
- `fs/knowledge.rs` → `fs/knowledge/{mod,types,dir,gc}.rs`

### Remaining Known Layering Violations

- `handoff/mod.rs` re-exports from `orchestrator/continuation/` (workaround for spawner dependencies)
- `models/stage/types.rs` imports TruthCheck, WiringTest, etc. from `plan/schema/types.rs` (circular dep)
- `plan/schema/types.rs` re-exports StageType, ExecutionMode, WiringCheck from models (circular dep)
