# worktree-isolation.sh - PreToolUse hook to enforce worktree boundaries
#
# This hook intercepts tool calls and blocks operations that would violate
# worktree isolation boundaries:
#
# For Bash tool:
#   - Block `git -C` or `git --work-tree` (accessing other git dirs)
#   - Block `../../` path traversal (escaping worktree)
#   - Block `.worktrees/` access (except current worktree)
#
# For Edit/Write tools:
#   - Block paths outside worktree bounds
#   - Block writes to `.work/stages/` and `.work/sessions/`
#
# Input: JSON from stdin (Claude Code passes tool info via stdin)
#   {"tool_name": "Bash|Edit|Write", "tool_input": {...}, ...}
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - Allow the operation
#   2 - Block with guidance message
#
# Environment:
#   LOOM_STAGE_ID - Current stage ID (set by loom)
#   LOOM_WORKTREE_PATH - Path to current worktree (if set)

  LOOM: BLOCKED - Git directory override detected
============================================================

You tried to: Use git -C or --work-tree to access another directory

This is FORBIDDEN in loom worktrees because:
  - Each worktree has its own isolated git state
  - Cross-worktree git operations corrupt state

Instead, you should:
  - Run git commands in the CURRENT worktree only
  - Use relative paths within this worktree
  - Stay confined to your assigned worktree

Git commands should operate on the current directory.

============================================================
  LOOM: BLOCKED - Path traversal detected
============================================================

You tried to: Use ../../ to escape the worktree

This is FORBIDDEN in loom worktrees because:
  - You are CONFINED to this worktree
  - Accessing parent directories breaks isolation
  - Other worktrees/stages may be affected

Instead, you should:
  - Use relative paths WITHIN this worktree
  - All files you need are in the worktree
  - Context is in your signal file (.work/signals/)

Stay within your worktree boundaries.

  LOOM: BLOCKED - Cross-worktree access detected
============================================================

You tried to: Access .worktrees/ directory (another stage's worktree)

This is FORBIDDEN because:
  - Each stage has its own isolated worktree
  - Accessing other stages' worktrees breaks isolation
  - You may corrupt another stage's work

Instead, you should:
  - Stay in YOUR worktree: .worktrees/${CURRENT_STAGE}/
  - Your files and context are all here
  - Communicate via .work/ (shared state symlink)

You can only access your own worktree.

============================================================
  LOOM: BLOCKED - Protected state file access
============================================================

You tried to: Write to .work/stages/ or .work/sessions/

This is FORBIDDEN because:
  - Stage and session files are managed by loom CLI
  - Direct edits corrupt orchestrator state
  - This causes phantom completions and lost work

Instead, you should:
  - Use `loom stage complete` to complete a stage
  - Use `loom memory` to record insights
  - NEVER manually edit .work/ state files

Use loom CLI commands to manage state.

============================================================
  LOOM: BLOCKED - Cross-worktree file write
============================================================

You tried to: Write to another stage's worktree

This is FORBIDDEN because:
  - Each stage owns its worktree exclusively
  - Writing to other worktrees causes conflicts
  - You may overwrite another agent's work

Instead, you should:
  - Write only to files in YOUR worktree
  - Your worktree: .worktrees/${CURRENT_STAGE}/
  - Files are merged after stage completion

Stay in your assigned worktree.

============================================================
  LOOM: BLOCKED - Path traversal in file path
============================================================

You tried to: Use ../../ in a file path to escape the worktree

This is FORBIDDEN because:
  - You must stay within your worktree
  - Path traversal could access main repo or other worktrees
  - This breaks isolation guarantees

Instead, you should:
  - Use relative paths within the worktree
  - Or use paths starting with ./ for current directory
  - All needed files are in your worktree

Use paths relative to the worktree root.
